User-specific data (profiles, private deals) is nested under `/users/{userId}` for strict, path-based security rules. A new root-level collection, `/publishedDeals`, is introduced to support the 'Community Deals' feature. When a user publishes a deal, a copy is placed in this collection, which has read-only access for all authenticated users. The `comments` subcollection is added to `publishedDeals` to allow community interaction on public deals, with rules allowing authenticated users to read and write comments."
