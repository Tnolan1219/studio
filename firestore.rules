/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for TKN Fi RE application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data while providing a public space for shared deals.  User data and private deals are accessible only to the owning user. Public deals are copied to a top-level collection for community access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile data, accessible only to the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/deals/{dealId}: Private deal data, accessible only to the user.
 * - /publishedDeals/{dealId}: Publicly shared deals, readable by all authenticated users, writable only by the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - Public deals are denormalized (copied) to the /publishedDeals collection for efficient public reads.
 * - Data validation is limited to ownership checks and relationship integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Deals intended for the community are copied to the `publishedDeals` collection, along with the `authorName`. This avoids complex queries and allows public read access.
