/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated deals and comments.
 * Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping and schema iteration.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/deals/{dealId}: Stores deals created by the user. Only the user can read/write their own deals.
 * - /users/{userId}/deals/{dealId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on a deal. Only the author can create comments; only the deal owner can read, update or delete them.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only access their own profile data and deals.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Ownership is enforced by matching the `userId` path segment with the authenticated user's UID.
